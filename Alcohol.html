		<h1> ALCOHOL </h1>

		<h2> OVERVIEW: </h2>

		<p1 class="italic1">

			Jugs that held beer and wine have been found dating
			back to 3500
			B.C. It was easy enough for prehistoric peoples
			to make alcohol. Mixtures of water and berries left
			alone
			in the sun turned into alcohol. Alcohol
			had its
			medicinal
			qualities as well. It was used as a disinfectant,
			to
			stimulate the flow of milk in nursing mothers, and to
			remedy
			a variety of illnesses.
			By the Middle Ages, the upper classes consumed
			alcohol in abundance, while the peasant population made
			beer at home. In Italy and France, wine became an
			important product in commercial markets and continued
			to be an integral part of the European economy throughout
			the Renaissance period. Home brewing was largely
			replaced
			by the commercial manufacture of beer and
			wine
			in Europe by the early eighteenth century.
			The first distillery in the United States opened in
			New York in 1640. Mass production, international trade,
			and expanding commercialism facilitated an increase in
			alcohol use into the twentieth century and brought with
			it concern over alcohol abuse.
			In the United States there have been historical
			increases and decreases in alcohol use. There were high
			periods of alcohol consumption during the Civil War,
			World War I, and World War II.But Alcohol remains the most commonly used
			legal drug, and consumption of alcohol by young people
			is very high.

		<h3>CHEMICAL/ORGANIC COMPOSITION:</h3>
		<p2 class="italic2">

			The chemical composition for ethanol or ethyl alcohol,
			otherwise known as alcohol, is C
			2
			H
			OH. This means
			it is composed of two atoms of carbon, six atoms of
			5
			hydrogen, and one oxygen atom. Ethanol is colorless and
			highly flammable. Alcohol is too strong to drink by
			itself, so it is mixed with water and other substances to
			create alcoholic beverages. Ethyl alcohol is the only safe
			alcohol to drink. Other alcohols like methanol (wood
			alcohol; CH
			OH) and isopropyl alcohol [rubbing alcohol;
			(CH
			3
			)
			2
			3
			ALCOHOL

			OFFICIAL NAMES: Ethyl alcohol, ethanol, grain alcohol
			STREET NAMES: Booze, hooch, juice, sauce, spirits
			DRUG CLASSIFICATIONS: Not classified, depressant
			CHOH] are highly toxic and poisonous to the
			body.
			Alcohol is produced by fermenting fruits, vegetables,
			and grains. Fermentation occurs when sugar in
			berries
			or grains is combined with yeast. An
			enzyme is
			released
			that changes the sugar into carbon dioxide and
			alcohol.
			When
			the combination of sugar,
			yeast, and
			berries or grains is combined with yeast. An enzyme is
			released that changes the sugar into carbon dioxide and
			alcohol. When the combination of sugar, yeast, and
			berries reaches an alcohol concentration point of 14%,
			fermentation is complete and wine is formed.
		</p2>
		<br/>
		<p5 class="italic5">
			Similarly,
			when sugar, yeast, and grains such as barley, corn, or rice
			are combined and reach an alcohol concentration of
			about 6%, beer is made and fermentation stops.
			Hard liquor is produced by a process called distillation.
			In distillation, liquids that have been fermented are
			boiled
			and the alcohol is extracted. At
			the boiling point,
			the
			alcohol separates from the fermented liquid to create
			a
			vapor.
			The
			vapor is held in a cooling tube until it turns
			into
			a liquid once again. The
			alcohol is then mixed with
			water.
			Hard liquor is about 60% water.
			Whiskey,
			rum,
			vodka,
			scotch, and gin are distilled liquors. These
			alcoholic
			beverages contain about 50% alcohol. The
			percentage
			of alcohol in hard liquor is called �proof.� Proof
			is
			double the amount of pure alcohol, which means that
			a
			100 proof whiskey contains 50% alcohol. A
			4-ounce
			glass of wine, a 12-ounce beer, and a 1-ounce shot glass
			of hard liquor all have the same amount of alcohol or
			alcohol content. Cordials like brandy, port, and liqueurs
			are made from wine and have pure alcohol added to
			them. Sugar is added to make them sweet, thus hiding
			the taste of alcohol and making these drinks seem less
			potent than they really are.

		<h4>MENTAL EFFECTS </h4>
		<br/>
		<img src="Alcohol2.jpg">
		<br/>
		<p3 class="italic3">

			Alcohol acts as a depressant on the brain. Blood
			carries alcohol to the brain, where it acts on the body’s
			central nervous system to slow a person’s mental
			responses. There are a variety of mental effects associated
			with alcohol consumption. The
			more immediate are:
			a
			lessening of inhibitions, mental relaxation, exaggerated
			emotional response to people and situations, extreme
			changes
			in behavior,
			and impaired judgment. Low doses
			of
			alcohol can cause the release of certain chemicals in
			the
			brain that can cause a sense of euphoria—a

			“high”
			that makes alcohol seem like a stimulant. Memory is
			sharpened and the ability to think creatively is strengthened,
			but when alcohol consumption increases, its seda-
			tive effects cause a loss of self-control and inhibition. A
			self-conscious individual becomes more confident; a shy
			person becomes more talkative. Alcohol also can cause
			people to become argumentative or emotionally withdrawn.
			Relationship problems can develop. Judgment is
			affected
			and risk-taking behaviors can result. People are
			known
			to do things under the influence of alcohol that
			they
			would never consider doing when sober.
			As alcohol consumption increases and levels of alcohol in the blood
			rise,
			the reflexes are slowed; memory loss and a sense of
			confusion
			can occur.
			Committing crimes or being the
			victim
			of a crime, domestic violence, child abuse, automobile
			accidents, homicide, and suicide are among the
			events
			related to the consumption of alcohol.
			<br/>
			The effects of alcohol are related to the size of the
			person and the amount of alcohol in the blood, as well as
			to the rate of consumption. After one drink a person
			weighing about 150 lb (68 kg) will feel relaxed and
			happy. After two drinks in an hour a person will fell less
			inhibited. Three drinks will affect a person’s muscle control.
			Speech can become slurred and walking may be difficult.
			After
			four drinks judgment is affected
			and the
			ability
			to reason becomes impaired. Five drinks will
			make
			speech patterns difficult
			to understand and impair
			vision.
			After
			six drinks a person may begin to lose consciousness
			and fall asleep. Ten
			or more drinks can cause
			a
			person to fall into a deep sleep also known as “passing
			out.”
