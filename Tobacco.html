		<h1>TOBACCO/NICOTINE </h1>

		<h2> OVERVIEW: </h2>

		<p1 class="italic1">
Nicotine dependence is almost invariably caused by
addiction to tobacco, because tobacco is the overwhelming
source of nicotine. Nicotine present within tobacco
products
causes physical and mental effects
rapidly leading
to addiction, and the user continues using tobacco
despite
adverse health consequences and usually a desire
to
stop. The
widespread use of tobacco, despite its
known dangers, probably reflects its low cost and easy
availability, its high level of social acceptance until
recent years, and its seemingly mild immediate side
effects.
<br/>
Nicotine use often begins in adolescence in
response to commercial and social pressures and continues
because of the positively reinforcing effects
of nicotine,
which can include both relaxation and increased
alertness.
In later stages of use, smoking may be used
mainly
to relieve withdrawal symptoms such as irritabil-
ity and discomfort.

		<h3>CHEMICAL/ORGANIC COMPOSITION:</h3>
		<p2 class="italic2">
Nicotine (C
10
H
14
N
, beta-pyridyl-alpha-N
methylpyrrolidine) is a very poisonous, water- and lipidsoluble,
liquid alkaloid with a burning taste. It is colorless,
but turns brown and takes on the odor of tobacco
upon
exposure to air.
First isolated in 1828, it is used as
an
insecticide in agriculture, and as a killer of parasites
in
veterinary medicine.
<br/>
Tobacco plant leaves of two species, Nicotiana
tobacum and the milder flavored Nicotiana rusticum,
generally contain 2�8% nicotine. The average cigarette
contains between 8 and 10 mg. Some nicotine is lost
from the tobacco leaf during the curing (slow drying in
sun, hot air, or smoke), storing, and manufacturing
processes. The NCI points out that each can of chewing
tobacco holds a lethal dose of nicotine. Also, each tin ofsnuff delivers as much nicotine as 30�40 cigarettes, with
4.5�6.5 mg nicotine per pinch. Holding a pinch of snuff
in the mouth for 20�30 minutes yields nicotine levels
two to three times the amount of nicotine delivered by a
regular-size cigarette.<br/>
Burned tobacco contains some 4,800 distinct chemicals
in either gas or particle phases. Many of the compounds
in both phases are highly reactive, poisonous,
and
toxic. Harmful products include oxidants and poisons
produced during burning, as well as radioactivity,
heavy
metals, and pesticides that may have accumulated
within
the tobacco leaf. Sixty-nine of these substances
are known to cause cancer in humans and animals, and
many others are known to be strong irritants.

		<h4>MENTAL EFFECTS </h4>

		
		<p3 class="italic3">
Nicotine has several effects that are due to its
action on the brain. Beginning smokers may experience
dizziness or lightheadedness and sometimes vertigo. At
higher doses, nausea and vomiting may occur. These
effects can also be elicited in chronic smokers with forced, rapid smoking. Most smokers learn to avoid
such unpleasant effects by adjusting their inhalation
patterns.<br/>
Studies have indicated that there are two major
pleasurable effects of nicotine ingestion that reinforce
the habit: stimulation (vigilance, wakefulness) and
relaxation. Tobacco users may feel that smoking helps
them concentrate and feel clear headed, and studies do
show that nicotine causes an improvement in attention,
recall, information processing, reaction time, and problem
solving. Smokers may also feel that smoking helps
them
relax in stressful situations or that it lifts their
mood.
They
may feel calm and experience less anger,
tension,
depression, and stress. Both stimulation and
relaxation
may be experienced at the same time, resulting
in a state of relaxed wakefulness.

				PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS
			</h8>
<br/>
As with the mental effects of nicotine, the physiological
effects
are brought about by its actions on the
nervous
system, both peripheral and central. Nicotine
changes
the transmission of nerve impulses by binding
to
acetylcholine receptors, and induces the release of
several
chemical messengers, which in turn affect
several
body systems.
<br/>
In the cardiovascular system, there is a 10 to 20 beat
per minute increase in heart rate, a 5�10 mm increase in
blood pressure, and an increase in the strength of heart
contractions. Nicotine increases the incidence of cardiac
arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) in susceptible people. It
causes constriction of blood vessels in the skin, and
causes platelets to adhere together leading to an
increased possibility of blood clots.
br/>
Nicotine is irritating to the digestive tract. Salivation
increases, and the strength of stomach contractions
decreases.
Nausea and vomiting may occur.
Appetite
is
suppressed,
particularly in females for sweet food.
Metabolism
is increased and brown fat is stimulated,
which
along with appetite suppression can lead to weight
loss.
<br/>
Nicotine causes local irritation in the respiratory
system, as well as decreased motion of the cilia, the tiny
hairs that sweep debris and mucus upward, out of the
respiratory tract. Arecurrent �smoker�s cough� results as
the body tries to rid itself of accumulated mucus. Breathing
is accelerated by nicotine.
